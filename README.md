# crystals
Crystals is an application in which the user is given a randomly selected number as the number to target.  The user has four crystals each assigned a random value that is hidden until clicked on.  Once clicked, the crystals value is added to the users current total.  The goal is to match the target number exactly without going over.  The application is built with JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, and CSS.
